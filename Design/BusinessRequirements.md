# Buisness Requirements

**Improve MVP to bring a more effective utilization loop to advisors and staff.**
- [BR1]
- We have been granted a minimum viable product already. 
  With this product we want to achieve improvements that will benefit the advisors engagement with the product. 
  We believe that this is a buisness requirement because of value it can bring to the company. 
  Time is a asset and when you can create shortcuts and bring a more effective style of tools to advisor you boost productivity.

**Bring customers an inviting and friendly product that is not difficult to utilize and provides valuable information.**
- [BR2]
- It has been established that the client would like to tend to the demographic of user that is utlizing the product. 
  With that we would like to deliver something that creates a inviting space for the user where they can thrive in using the product. 
  We believe that this is a buisness requirement because if we can achieve our goal of improving accessibility for the client they are more likely to refer someone or come back to use the service again.
