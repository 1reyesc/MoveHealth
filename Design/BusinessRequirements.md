# Business Requirements

**Enable Financial Advisors to better assist their clients with clear and easy to understand information about their health insurance.**
- [BR1]
- The primary users of this product are Financial Advisors, who, in turn, serve their own clients.
  The goal is to support Financial Advisors in helping their clients understand the details of their health insurance.
  By developing new features and enhancing existing ones we can help Financial Advisors explain health insurance details in a clear, digestible manner for their clients.
  We believe that this is a business requirement because the goal is to improve client understanding of insurance plans, thus adding value to both Advisors and their clients.
  By creating tools to enable this we can build credibility in this domain and expand our user base with a trusted and valued service. 

**Bring customers an inviting and friendly product that is not difficult to utilize and provides valuable information.**
- [BR2]
- It has been established that the client would like to tend to the demographic of user that is utlizing the product. 
  With that we would like to deliver something that creates a inviting space for the user where they can thrive in using the service. 
  We believe that this is a business requirement because if we can achieve our goal of improving accessibility for the client they are more likely to refer someone     or come back to use the service again.
