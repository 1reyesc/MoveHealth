# Move Health Platform Tech Stack

This is an outline of the tech stack chosen for the **Move Health Platform** and the reasoning behind those choices. These technologies were selected to meet specific requirements for scalability, ease of development, and the ability to integrate AI functionalities for financial document summarization.

## Frontend

**_Frameworks_.** - **React**

React is a widely-used JavaScript library for building interactive and responsive user interfaces for single-page applications. It was chosen due to its modular component-based architecture, which allows for efficient development and reusability of UI components. Additionally, React’s ecosystem has strong community support and numerous libraries that can be easily integrated into the project.

## Backend

**Database** - **PostgreSQL**

Ruby on Rails is a full-stack web application framework that prioritizes simplicity and convention over configuration. It was selected due to its rapid development features, built-in security capabilities, and ease of integration with APIs.

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that excels in handling large datasets and complex queries. It was selected for its ACID compliance, reliability, and support for complex financial data structures.

## AI Tool
