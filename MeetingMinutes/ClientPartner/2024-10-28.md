## Topics Discussed

We discussed what we plan to do with the software and then we went through how to set up the environment step by step with error handling.  

## Things Clarified

We clarified a lot do with how the project runs and who to go to for issues. Everything was done on Solomon's computer and they weren't able to complete everything in the time spent on the meeting, Solomon was able to figure a lot out of the meeting and then help everyone else (still currently working through Mia's issues) with getting their environments setup as well.
