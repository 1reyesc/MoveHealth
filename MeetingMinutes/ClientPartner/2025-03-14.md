## Topics Discussed
For this meeting we covered all of the improvements and features that have been added to this iteration. We also discussed some of the things that are being calculated in our ROTH conversion calculator. Cole gave some 
really good insight on what to add and take out of the feature. We also discussed what would ideally be accomplished moving forward.

## Things Clarified
The things that were clarified are what was exactly expected from the Roth Conversion Calulator. We discussed also about what to continue dedicating ourselves to as we move forward.
