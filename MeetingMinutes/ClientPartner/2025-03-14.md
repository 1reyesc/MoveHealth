## Topics Discussed
For this meeting we covered all of the improvements and features that have been added to this iteration. We also discussed some of the things that are being calculated in our ROTH conversion calculator. Cole gave some 
really good insight on what to add and take out of the feature. We also discussed what would ideally be accomplished moving forward.

## Things Clarified
The things that were clarified are what was exactly expected from the Roth Conversion Calulator. We discussed also about what to continue dedicating ourselves to as we move forward.

## Client Use of Software
Our client utilized the remote desktop control for google meet to use our software. They tested the roth conversion calculator as that is the biggest feature of this iteration. They used the software for around half of the time that we were in the meeting. The first half was all demonstration and the second half was all feed back. There was a positive reaction to the software but there were things that could have been improved. Primarily the certain things that were being calculated inside the Roth Conversion Calculator.
