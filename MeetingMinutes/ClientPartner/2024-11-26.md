## Topics Discussed

We caught Cole up to speed on the first iteration and what we had for the second iteration. We had a lot of the front and backend fuctionality done to show Cole what the completer second iteration would like for the user, we still had a lot to work on test and other technical stuff. 

## Things Clarified

Cole gave some input on changes he would like to see design wise. 
Suggestions for design changes
- Shows only on the first visit
- Being conditional: Rather than have everything, maybe hyperlinks 
- Conditional to what ever page you are on 
- Minimizing scrolling 
- How to make it look stand-alone and look more cohesive to and also a seperate part of the page (Maybe make it navy blue with white text)
- File name bleeds over, anyway to fix that?
- We are still working on formating things properly

we were unfortuantly unable to talk about iteration 3 features because Cole had to go to a meeting at 2:30 and our discussion already began to cut into that a bit.
