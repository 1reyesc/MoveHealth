## Topics Discussed

We dove deep into the Roth vs APTC conversion calculator. We discussed what things he enjoy'd and dislike'd about the feature. Got a ton of great feedback on that. We also showcased the other UI fixes that we achieved and the tutorial update we made. Cole was very impressed with things that we achieved and was excited to see the milestones we hit.

## Things Clarified

We clarified what calculations should be made inside the roth conversion calculator and how cole felt about the changes we made to output for the chat functionality. We also talked about the formating of the UI for the roth conversion calculator. At this time we had the CLI functionality so we got more input and better insight on how to structure the rest going forward.
