## Topics Discussed

We talked about beginning to work on delegating assignments for the iteration and working towards making progress that we can present to the team next meeting. 
We are using a kanban board software called backlog.com to track all of our progess and get things done.
We added all of our functional requirements into the backlog as issues so that we can track our progess. We also officially decided who will be doing what. Solomon and Caleb are back end. Cyarina and Mia are front end.
Tobi is going to float between the two and help where the iteration is more heavily loaded.

## Things Clarified

Going to meet this week once we get the environment sent to us. We are also going to meet at the end of the week to showcase the progress we have made on the issues in the kanban board.
