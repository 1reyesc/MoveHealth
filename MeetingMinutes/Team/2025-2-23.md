## Topics Discussed

We discussed our upcoming client meeting and pair programmed on the new features that we were implementing that iteration. We split off into our respective teams and pair programmed with our partners.

## Things Clarified

There is not set in stone plan for this upcoming week because of spring break but we are leaving it at that we would like to have all the features ready for presentation by the end of spring break. We discussed 
a mentor meeting as well another client meeting. Once returning from spring break, with the features already ready to go we will devote the last week to testing and preparing that aspect of the project.
