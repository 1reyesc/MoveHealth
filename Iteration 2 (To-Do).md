### Iteration 2 Development Goals

#### 1. **Unassisted User Onboarding**
   - **Objective**: Ensure that new users can set up and begin using the platform independently, without requiring manual assistance.
   - **Description**: This feature will introduce an intuitive onboarding flow that automatically guides users through the initial setup process. By providing clear, step-by-step guidance, it helps users understand the primary platform functions from the start. Key aspects include:
      - **Welcome Screen**: A brief overview of the platform’s main benefits and a "Get Started" button.
      - **Setup Checklist**: An interactive checklist to introduce users to important steps (e.g., uploading documents, navigating the chatbox, accessing summaries).
   - **Outcome**: With this feature, first-time users will be empowered to navigate the platform independently, enhancing user satisfaction and reducing onboarding time.

#### 2. **First-Time User Tips**
   - **Objective**: Equip new users with guidance on the platform’s essential features, making the user experience more intuitive and reducing the learning curve.
   - **Description**: This feature will provide instructional tooltips and navigational prompts that appear at key points of interaction for first-time users. The tips will explain how each main feature works, appearing only when the user first encounters each feature. Key areas include:
      - **Document Upload**: Tips to guide users through uploading health insurance documents, including supported file types and drag-and-drop functionality.
      - **Chatbox Use**: Initial prompts that explain how to ask questions, receive summaries, and edit documents using the AI chatbox.
      - **Dashboard Navigation**: Tooltips to clarify dashboard metrics, user limits, and report-generation options.
   - **Outcome**: First-time users will have a smoother, more informed experience as they learn the platform's capabilities, promoting confidence in using the platform’s full suite of features.

#### 3. **Enhanced Chat Functionality**
   - **Objective**: Expand the AI chatbox’s capabilities to offer more comprehensive assistance, going beyond basic PDF summarization to support users in understanding and interacting with document content.
   - **Description**: Currently, the chatbox provides document summaries, but this feature will increase its responsiveness and flexibility. The enhanced chat function will allow the AI to interpret a broader range of user queries and engage more interactively with document content. Key additions include:
      - **Question Answering**: The chatbox will answer specific questions about document content, offering quick, relevant information rather than only providing summaries.
      - **Clarifications and Explanations**: Users can request clarification on particular terms, sections, or concepts within the document, and the chatbox will respond with contextual information.
      - **Action Suggestions**: For documents requiring further action (e.g., follow-up appointments or policy updates), the AI can suggest next steps or highlight critical sections that may need user attention.
   - **Outcome**: With these enhancements, the chatbox will serve as a more robust, interactive assistant, empowering users to understand complex information and make informed decisions based on the document content.
