## How we felt about the symposium 

Tobi: I really enjoyed the symposium. It was fun to get to display our poster and out project and talk to people. We had a lot of really great reactions to the project. The downside of the symposium was there weren't a lot of technical people so one person did ask what RubyOnRails was and when I said a programming language they asked what that was as well... which is a fair question I quess. I do wish we had more of a warm up talking to people about our project before the judges came to talk to us but overall I'd say it was a fun experience!
