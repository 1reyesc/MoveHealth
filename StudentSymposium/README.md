## How we felt about the symposium 

Tobi: I really enjoyed the symposium. It was fun to get to display our poster and out project and talk to people. We had a lot of really great reactions to the project. The downside of the symposium was there weren't a lot of technical people so one person did ask what RubyOnRails was and when I said a programming language they asked what that was as well... which is a fair question I quess. I do wish we had more of a warm up talking to people about our project before the judges came to talk to us but overall I'd say it was a fun experience! 

Solomon: The symposium was less nerve-wracking than I thought. There wasn't that many people that attended which was both a good thing and a bad thing I thought. It sucks that we weren't able to share our project with a lot more people, but because of the lack of people, we knew that those who came to our poster were genuinely interested. I was reluctant to go at first but I'm glad I did because it was a cool experience. '

Mia: I enjoyed the symposium because we got to share our hard work with others. There wasnt many people who stopped by but the ones who stopped by liked our project.It as a good experience as well for me. I think the layout of our posted did draw people in.
